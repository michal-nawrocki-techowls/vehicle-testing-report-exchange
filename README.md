#  VIX - Vehicle Information eXchange

Vehicle Information eXchange is an open-source project established to define and set the standards and protocols
for systems to exchange information related to vehicle services, safety and dealership.
The need to exchange information is driven in part by compliance to government relations, but also for
day to day operations of fleet managers, workshops, hire & lease operators and dealers.

## The challenge
The market offers software products that can generally be grouped as:
- Fleet management (FM)
- Workshop & garage management (WG)
- Hire & lease management (RL)
- Sales management (SM) 

Businesses that operate in these areas often have the need  and/or requirement to
communicate with other parties within the same or across different groups. 
This communication is based on exchanging information in the form of documents. 
For example:

- HDV/PSV operator needs to obtain and store safety inspection data from workshops in order to 
comply with DVSA requirements.
- HDV/PSV operator is required to ensure that any hired or 
leased vehicle is in roadworthy condition and holds valid certificates to operate on the road.
- Vehicle dealer wants to access and share inspection reports with other parties.  

This exchange of information is very slow, repetitive and 
in most cases requires manual export/import of data.   

## Goals of the project
 - Establish a common rule for organizations to communicate with each other in robust and secure way.
 - Implement a simple and safe markup language for documents foe exchanging information.
 - Provide tools for software providers to test their products against agreed standards

## Benefits
This project will help organizations share information instantly and more securely. It will reduce
errors, improve access to information and allow businesses to focus on their core activities.
For software providers, it will increase marketability of the product and help them deliver and 
shape the industry.
